    "I did a search for post about privacy and found 2 redditors that indicated not caring about privacy on the internet and that they've accepted that using social media gives up their privacy. So to me these are fair game, if you are one of those 2 users and want to be removed from this example please feel free to message me.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "More on ethics.. Ethics are a funny concept. I think it's up to you to decide what is ethical. In my view ethics always favor the dominant parties in a group in control of the thought leadership. So I'm not the biggest fan of not doing things because someone says they are considered by some to be unethical. In this exercise I did attempt to follow status quo ethics but the choice is yours in your own research.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "I extend these my views on ethics to other things as well. If the API for something like Reddit doesn't work, there is no harm in accessing it by other means and extracting the information you want. Sites like reddit or Facebook use the internet but try as they might they don't control it. One of the favorite techniques used by these sites is obfuscated crap like that mentioned in this [article](https://css-tricks.com/how-facebook-avoids-ad-blockers/).   \n",

    "## Analysis  \n",
    "- Inferring age from interests\n",
    "    - On reddit some people may post their age in common phrases like \"I'm only 23\" or \"Us millenials\" etc. You can create a model that takes their attributes and predicts age using those that stated their age bands as \"training data\".   \n",
    "- Inferring other things\n",
    "    - Once a user has stated something, I'm from Chicago, I like surfing and do it every day, etc. you can do they same modeling exercise. Come up with a likelihood model that someone is also from Chicago.\n",
    "- Should I move to \"XXX\"\n",
    "    - Analyze followers of various city/country subreddits to see how likely you are to have similar interests to redditors in the place you are considering. \n",
    "    - Apply this to any commonalities you might be interested in seeing. Comapre your account to the subreddit's typical users.\n",
    "- Deviation from the  norm\n",
    "    - People on reddit have one major thing in common, they've chosen to user reddit. This is very different from people who have not. It also means they are on the internet, may have relatively stable internet access, among other things.  \n",
    "    - In doing analysis you may want to account for how a user differs from the average reddit user, I'd reckon the average reddit user values formal education and liberal idealogy more than the real world. If you are trying to make sense of people as a whole you may want to temper your expectations a bit in terms of how prevalent certain leaning sites and dogmas may be\n",
    "  \n",
    "Another type of analysis commonly done on users is cluster analysis. What types of users make up this subreddit? There isn't necessarily one typical user, just a most common. Many subgroups and cliques may follow a certain subreddit. Starwars followers would be a good place to see the difference between old and young users.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Cool Project Idea\n",
    "Tie in some of the analysis from before and create a reddit plugin (can be browser based) that gives you details of the reddit account you are reading. Show their karma, whether they comment in posts they create, where they are from, their estimated age, etc.  "
